# CHAreaModel

This repo offers model outputs, model analysis code, and model source code for the final model described in our paper "Forecasting solar wind streams from coronal holes using solar images". The "analysisNB.ipynb" jupyter notebook can be used to reproduce the RMSE table from our paper. We also include the list of ICMEs used to produce the ICME breakdown figures. "unetResnet18.py" gives the code for the final model.

U-Net source (unet folder) is available at https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet. Resnet source code available at https://github.com/pytorch/vision.
